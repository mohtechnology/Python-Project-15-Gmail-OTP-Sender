# Gmail OTP Sender
In this video, I demonstrate how to send OTP (One-Time Password) emails using Python's `smtplib`. This is a practical project for those looking to implement email-based verification in their applications.

## In this tutorial, we will:

- Generate a random OTP using the `random` library.
- Compose the email message with the OTP.
- Use the `smtplib` library to send the email via Gmail's SMTP server.
